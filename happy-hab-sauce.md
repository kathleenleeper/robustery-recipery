# ingredients

5 habaneros, (deseeded for slightly less spicy)

1 large carrot
1 head of garlic
1 cup lime juice
1/4 cup white vinegar
2/3 cup olive oil (regular, not extra virgin)
1 tbsp salt
1 tbsp cumin

#instructs

Cook habeneros in a covered pot till soft, then set aside. Coarsely chop carrot, onion, and garlic. Add to pot with olive oil, simmer on medium low untill soft. Take the pot off heat and add habeneros, lime juice, white vinegar, salt, and cumin. Blend with immersion blender or regular blender untill smooth.

Chef's notes: all ingredients are approximate; increase lime or olive oil to decrease thickness. Increasing the carrot and onion can dilute the heat, but not that much. Handle habenero's with gloves to avoid severe pain and suffering.
