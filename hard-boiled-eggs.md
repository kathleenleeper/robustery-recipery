Makes perfect hard boiled eggs every time!
 - fill a large pot of water with enough to submerge eggs by about an inch and a half
 - bring water to a full boil
 - gently drop in eggs, straight from the fridge (a ladle helps!)
 - let boil for ~thirty seconds before turning heat down to lowest.
 - let sit till temperature has converged.
 
remark 1: the goal is for the temperature to converge to around 175 F, such that the yokes have just set. 
remark 2: Kenji argues that boiling fresh from the fridge helps with ease of peeling, which I have generally found as well.
